# RebelBase Coding Challenge - CJL 

This challenge was started on march 4th of 2021, the main goal was to achieve most of the design and functionality that were describe on the instructions. 

The dependencies used for this proyect were: 
- [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/)
- [React Router Dom](https://reactrouter.com/web/guides/quick-start)
- [React-beautiful-dnd](https://github.com/atlassian/react-beautiful-dnd)

The most challenging topics during this days were: 
- Drag and drop of the Items
- Display date and hour according to the checkbox
- Change the border of the item cards when they were selected. 

For that reason I searched and used the following tutorials/explanations: 
- [How to Add Drag and Drop in React with React Beautiful DnD](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-add-drag-and-drop-in-react-with-react-beautiful-dnd/)
- [Use react hooks (useState) to toggle an active div.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lx-YlI9hlY)

This proyect allow me to work with elements that I already knew, and with other functionalitys that I didn't know. 

But in the case that I could iterate the proyect, the main focus would it be: 
- Get to the display date and hour of the item selected and not in all of them, 
- Upgrade UI from DateHour.jsx, 
- Enable "Select All" option in DashboardAll.jsx, 
- Display the data with the division of topics in DashboardAll.jsx (ecosystem in validation, and the others under ideation), 
- And enhance the App acording to the feedback that I would recive.
